## Workforce.com Adnat Challenge

### **What I learned**:

- First and foremost that Rails has frontend capabilities. I didn't know that before going into this challenge. I definitely spent quite a bit of time learning. For instance, how the helper methods for redirecting to routes work, how the views and routes connect, and the naming conventions that bring it all together.

- Secondly, I would probably rethink how I was setting up my authentication. I would probably look more into the devise gem, and try to set up that way.

- It has been a while since I coded in Ruby, so this challenge was a lot of fun bringing those skills back into the daylight. I was reminded about why I loved learning Ruby in the first place and had a lot of fun. It really felt like riding a bike after not having ridden one in a while.

- I began the challenge creating the backend, something I'm more familiar with. Once I was able to prove that every api I hit was successful, I started to add in the frontend. Probably because I am more familiar with Vue.js and having a more decoupled backend and frontend is why I took this approach. Next time, I probably will try to do it all in one swoop because I think it would be more efficient.
